Extracts string literals to an external .locstring file.
<p>
    When the cursor is on a string constant inside a JavaScript / TypeScript file, the "**Extract string literal to locstring file**" intention action will become available.
    When invoked, a balloon dialog will pop open with option to modify the new locstring entry's key, value and comment.

    The nearest locstring file to the edited code file will be automatically selected.
    If no locstring file was found within 3 directory levels up, a new locstring file path will be suggested.
